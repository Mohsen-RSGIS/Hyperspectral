Hyperspectral Imagery Processing

This repository contains Hyperspectral Imagery Processing algorithms (e.g., training and test sample selection (in number and percent), K-means clustering, and Maximum Likelihood Classification) implemented by Python3+.

Note: For the optimum usage of the codes, it is better to place all the downloaded files in a common path.
